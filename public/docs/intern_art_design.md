# Art Department Intern
at FanTank

Los Angeles, CA. – USA

We&#39;re looking for a smart and motivated design intern to join our nimble, little Creative team for a term of 6 months.

Your home base will be The Art Department, FanTank&#39;s in-house creative team. We collaborate with every other team in the company and deliver original work suited for their particular needs.

We work with these teams:

Copywriting, Product Design, Product Engineering (iOS, Android), Marketing, Events, Music, Modeling, PR, Branding, Fashion, Social Media.

On these types of executions:

- Illustrations and animations
- Printed materials and wearable items
- Typography, layout, logo and brand development
- Photography and video direction
- We speak plainly to each other, listen carefully to the people we work with every day, and create things that others can understand in a voice that&#39;s distinctly FanTank.

As an Art Department intern, you&#39;ll:

- Work on real projects. Product announcements, UI &amp; UX art, branding efforts, ads, flyers, presentations—whatever comes our way.
- Learn how to collaborate with people from every part of the company.
- Infuse your unique perspective into our day-to-day work.
- Oh, you design typefaces? Let&#39;s talk.
- Have a fantastic six months in Los Angeles.

The point is you&#39;ll do real work, helping the team take things from concept to product. What we&#39;re looking for:

- A positive attitude and a willingness to develop your skills.
- A creative problem solver. Someone who looks for the best design, not the most obvious.

- A self-starter. You don&#39;t sit around waiting for opportunities to come to you.
- Knowledgeable in the fundamentals of design and typography.
- An expert in Adobe CS.
- A keen eye for detail and consistency.
- Humility and the ability to accept and manage feedback. This is important.
- Humor, niceness, and an allergy to the platitudes and jargon of the tech industry.
- Interests outside of the design and tech worlds.
- A FanTank user with a deep understanding of the product and community.
- Experience with animation, video, 3D, or other new media is a plus.

We&#39;ll need to see:

- A portfolio with relevant work.
- 3-5 sentences about why you&#39;d like to design for FanTank.

Bonus:

Our ideal candidate is in or going into their senior year, and is interested in the prospect of future employment at FanTank.
