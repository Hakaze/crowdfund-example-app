Your device-IDs are used to ensure that you are in control of the devices that have access to your Subscription.

* To provide information technology services and visual dashboards to users that are separated into three groups (1) content (2) talent scouting (3) social media data scrapping. FanTank will provide an artist user with real time ranking information that is based upon the characteristics of the user who is providing numerical feedback on the artist’s content.  For example, the artist may want to know where he ranks compared to all other artists in his art form and / or genre according to the voting inputs according to that users gender, geographic location, user type, badge level, and more.

* To identify you as the creator of the content that you upload, the score you apply to content or the other contributions that you make to the Platform.

* To seek your participation in surveys, and to conduct and analyze the results of those surveys if you choose to participate.

* To provide you with technical support.

* To respond to you about any comment or enquiry you have submitted.

* To provide other users with data regarding people's listening behavior of their sounds, i.e. streaming and downloading their sounds or playlists or following their profiles.

* To prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of our [Terms of Use](https://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use), [Community Guidelines](https://soundcloud.com/community-guidelines) or applicable law.

* We use your month and year of birth to enable age restriction.

* Any additional information that you provide as part of your public profile, such as your real name, and links to your website and other social media profiles (but not your email address), will be published on your profile page. This information will be publicly accessible and may be viewed by anyone accessing the Website, or using our API or other Services. Please bear this in mind when considering whether to provide any additional information about yourself.

* If you purchase an I.T. Subscription, your name, address and payment verification information will be used to process your account subscription and renewals and to collect your payment. All payment verification information is transmitted using industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. FanTank also complies with the Payment Card Industry Security Standards.

All payment verification information is transmitted using industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. FanTank also complies with the Payment Card Industry Security Standards.

**Improving and customizing the Platform and advertising:**

* To analyze the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order to improve FanTank® and customize it to your needs and interests.

* To show you interesting FanTank ads, when you visit third party websites. When you see our ads on a third party website or apps, we or third party services we engage for this purpose, may collect information your browser or mobile app makes available when seeing the ad (e.g. ip-addresses, referral URL, browser details, timestamp of request). Third party websites or apps may also allow us to measure the success of our ads on their websites. This may include e.g. whether a click converted to an actual purchase of a Subscription. Please see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may be collected and how to opt-out.

* To show you ads on behalf of advertisers, we use information that you make available to us when you interact with the Platform including location data, together with information you provide to us through the Platform, e.g. demographic information, you choose to make available to us (such as your age or gender) directly or through third party services as well as information your browser sends us when using the Platform (e.g. referral URLs, device type or location data). This allows us to show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you. Please note that we do not share personal data with advertisers. Instead, advertisers pre-define a specific audience by certain generic criteria (e.g. the city of residence, the age range, or the number of followers of an unidentified user) for a specific ad campaign. If your profile matches these generic criteria, we may choose to display a suitable ad to you. We may also display ads based on the content that you have recently viewed or searched. Before we may use location data from the app for the first time, your mobile device will generally ask you for permission first. In case you gave permission to do so, location based services in your device will collect location data for a couple of seconds. These will then be shared with us or a respective service provider.

When we engage third party services such as ad-networks that enable us showing you interest based ads, we may also allow them to collect certain information such as cookie data from you. This information would allow these third-parties to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe would be of most interest to you. If you allow third party websites to collect and share data when you interact with their platform, ad-networks may use that information together with the information we allow them to collect on the Platform. Please see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may be collected and how to opt-out.

* To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may send to you from time to time.

For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the proposed use of your personal data.

**Sharing of your information**

We will not share your information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy (including our [Cookies Policy](https://soundcloud.com/pages/cookies)). There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows:

* **Other users**: Any information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by a pro user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that pro user as well as that you are following that pro user now, so that they can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments will be available to all users of the Platform.

* **With your consent**: We will disclose your information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information.

* **Service providers**: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide their services to us. Where we transfer personal data to these third parties, we ask and require these third parties to implement appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and only to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.

* **Users of our API**: FanTank has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the United States of America. Any information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile information and any uploaded content, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below.

* **Other networks and connected apps:** If you choose to connect your FanTank® account to other apps or social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn you will be sharing certain information with these apps or networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on FanTank® or any new favorites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your FanTank® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favorite or repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your content. FanTank® is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share, and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section below.

* Advertisers may use third party services to ensure their ads are properly served and to measure the success of their campaigns on websites and apps. We allow these services to collect and use the information for such purposes.

* **As aggregated data**: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life.

* **If required by law**: We will disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.

* **To protect our interests**: We may disclose your information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the FanTank® community.

* **In the context of a business transfer**: We may transfer your information to any person or company that acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of FanTank®, or on a merger of our business, or in the event of our insolvency.

**Cookies and similar technology**

In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar technology in a separate [Cookies Policy](https://soundcloud.com/pages/cookies) that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as bug reporting within our mobile apps.

Ads displayed to you are in some cases provided by third parties. These may and as far as allowed by your settings or your device, use information about your visit and interaction with the Platform in order to show you personalized ads of products and services that may be of interest to you. Personal information such as your name or email address will not be shared with these.

We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar technology. If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other technologies as described in our [Cookies Policy](https://soundcloud.com/pages/cookies), you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal data that we collect using these technologies.

**Choice and control**

We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of information you provide to us, and the control you have over that information.

It is not necessary for you to provide us with any personal data in order to visit the Website, although certain information will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a FanTank® account, you can control your information in the following ways.

**Email and notification preferences**

When you are signed into your account, you can access your Settings by clicking on the "settings icon" at the bottom right of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop down menu.

From the Notifications tab you can tell us:

* which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and

* which Activity Notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us.

You can also turn off email notifications from the Notifications tab within your Settings. This will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform.

It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications) at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email. You can add additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you in your Account Settings tab.

**Sharing with other apps and networks**

The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your FanTank® account.

If you sign up for FanTank® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your FanTank® account and your Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the content that you post, rating content on FanTank®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account. Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile, make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. If you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings.

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications before sharing your information with, or connecting your FanTank® account to, any of these third party sites or applications.

**Sharing with other users**

FanTank® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information.  If any of your sounds contain any personal data or any other information, which you would not like to share, you can control who has access to these sounds using the settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your sounds to "private", rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds.

**Sharing with app developers**

FanTank® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the waveform player, and uncheck the "Apps enabled" box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that is not publicly available on the Website.

**Customizing the Platform and personalized ads**

We may also use third party services using cookies or similar technologies showing you personalized ads on our behalf. Please see our [Cookies Policy](https://soundcloud.com/pages/cookies) for how to opt-out of those. Please be aware that even if you opt out of interest-based ads, you may still see ads, which likely are not as appealing to you.

**Cookies**

Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our [Cookies Policy](https://soundcloud.com/pages/cookies). Further information is available at [http://aboutcookies.org](http://aboutcookies.org/).

**App preferences**

You can use the settings within your iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the FanTank® tab. With an Android device you need to open the FanTank® app and open the basic settings tab within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.

**Deleting your account**

You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the content that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with that content and / or your historical voting data on artistic content that generates your Scouting Score will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.

Even if you delete your FanTank® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search engines' caching processes are outside of FanTank’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.

Please note that deleting any FanTank® Apps, or any third party apps to which your FanTank® account is connected, will not delete your FanTank® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your FanTank® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third party app.

**Access to your data**

As described above, most of the personal data and other information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings page of your FanTank® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal data we hold about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any personal data that we hold about you, please contact us at [privacy@fantank.com](mailto:privacy@fantank.com), or the address provided below.

If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal data in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we have a legitimate reason for doing so.

**International data transfers**

FanTank is based in the United States of America, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance with American laws. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal data in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

**Minors **

FanTank® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such personal data, please notify us immediately at [privacy@fantank.com](mailto:privacy@fantank.com).

**Changes and updates to this Privacy Policy**

1) I acknowledge that I have reviewed and agree with the FanTank Independent Talent Scout (ITS) Conditions, Requirements, and profit sharing commission payout procedures.

2) I acknowledge that I am an independent contractor and **not** an employee, partner, agent of, or joint venturer with FanTank for any purpose in any way. Instead, any user functioning on our platform as an independent talent scout in exchange for commission payouts is and will remain an independent contractor in my relationship to FanTank. FanTank shall not be held responsible for withholding taxes with respect to the user’s compensation hereunder. The Contractor shall have no claim against FanTank hereunder or otherwise for vacation pay, sick leave, retirement benefits, social security, worker's compensation, health or disability benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, or employee benefits of any kind.

3) I acknowledge that there are no requirements to purchase training materials, I.T. subscription services, promo / contest or any other services are required to become an ITS (Independent Talent Scout) and any purchase of sales aids, training materials, I.T. subscriptions, or promo entry fees is strictly voluntary.

4) In understand that in order to receive commission payouts, I must supply FanTank with a PayPal or bank account information.

5) I understand that my advancement to higher badge levels in the FanTank "ITS" Compensation Plan is based upon the following:

1. artist user types must upload content

2. all users must complete the registration steps, reach a certain "Scout Score" per badge level,  provide numerical feedback on a set # of artists every month, and have a set # of friends in user’s social network.

3. The "Scout Score" is calculated at the sole discretion of FanTank based upon its proprietary mathematical function that uses the score I apply to any content item that an artist user has uploaded to his or her page.  I can apply a content score from 0 to 9,876 on any item of content on the platform and FanTank applies a mathematical function to derive my “Scout Score” that ranks my acumen at evaluating talent compared to other users on the site that are also evaluating content,  # of votes I have done, and within what period of time the votes were done, and if I give more votes than required.

6. I understand that in order to receive commissions at any badge level, I must maintain the requirements for that badge level for at least 60 days prior to receiving commission payments at that particular badge level.

FanTank’s gross revenues are derived from:

1. promo / contest entry fees

2. information technology subscriptions to artists

3. information technology services to enterprise clients like distributors, talent agencies, producers, and more.

4. Mobile and Internet Advertising

5. Equity Crowd Funding Services

7. I acknowledge that FanTank’s commissions are based upon splitting up 10% of the Company’s net profits after all other corporate expenses has been accounted for.  Therefore as an "ITS", I am not guaranteed any income.  Similarly, I shall not represent directly or indirectly that any person may, can, or will earn any stated amount or that any ITS’ are guaranteed income.


8. I understand that the FanTank’s Services may be offered in different markets on terms and at rates determined by FanTank and that the markets where the products are offered and the terms and conditions or prices thereof may change from time to time without notice.

9. I understand that there is a fee to process all FanTank "ITS" Profit Sharing Payments. Therefore:

1. FanTank shall deduct a $10.00 processing fee that covers merchant account fees and the general overhead with processing such payments.

2. The ITS must be due a total commission payment amount of at least $11.00.  If not, this payment will accrue to the next month until this amount has been compounded.

3. ITS payments will not be done via processing a check, but instead will be done only via wire or transfer to my designated bank or Paypal account.

b) I agree that any payments made to me by FanTank that remain unclaimed by me after six (6) months shall be held in an account that is subject to an account maintenance fee of $25 per month (the "Account Maintenance Fee") which shall be deducted by FanTank monthly. If there are insufficient funds owed me from which to deduct the monthly Account Maintenance Fee when due, and I do not otherwise pay the Account Maintenance Fee, then the Account Maintenance Fee shall be prorated to reflect the amount of funds remaining and the account shall remain open for an equally prorated amount of time. When no unclaimed amounts are owed to me by FanTank the account shall be closed. I further acknowledge that unclaimed amounts owed to me may be subject to applicable escheat laws, which may require FanTank to deliver unclaimed funds to the state.

10. I understand that during any investigation by FanTank with respect to my breach of this Agreement or my conduct as an "ITS", my “ITS” position status may be suspended by FanTank and any FanTank Payments which may be otherwise owing to me shall be held until final resolution has been achieved. I acknowledge that in the event FanTank determines that I have violated this Agreement, including the FanTank Policies and Procedures or the “ITS” Compensation Plan, FanTank may terminate this Agreement and deactivate my FanTank and Badge position, in which event I will not be entitled to any FanTank Payments or further commissions or compensation of any kind.

11. IN NO EVENT WILL FANTANK, ANY OTHER FANTANK COMPANY OR ANY OTHER FANTANK PROVIDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, AND THE LIKE), ARISING OUT OF ANY CAUSE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR THE DELAY, ACT, ERROR OR OMISSION OF FANTANK, ANY FANTANK COMPANY OR ANY FANTANK PROVIDER, OR THE DELIVERY, NONDELIVERY, DISCONTINUATION, OR MODIFICATION OFANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE BY FANTANK, ANY FANTANK COMPANY, OR ANY FANTANK PROVIDER, EVEN IF FANTANK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

14. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California and the Federal Arbitration Act.  In the event of a dispute between FanTank and me as to our respective rights, duties and obligations arising out of or relating to this Agreement, it is mutually agreed that such disputes shall be exclusively resolved through the process and according to the provisions specified in the Federal Arbitration Act.

**V. Equity Crowd Funding Services Disclosure **

 

FanTank’s equity crowd funding services are done in accordance with a strategic alliance with BankRoll Ventures (BRV Technology LLC) through the website [www.BankRoll.Ventures](http://www.bankroll.ventures/), hereinafter collectively referred to as "BankRoll"). FanTank and BankRoll are not registered broker-dealers or investment advisors. FanTank and BankRoll do not give investment advice nor does either company endorse or recommend the purchase of, or investment in any securities, whether on their respective sites or otherwise. 

 

As part of its service offerings, FanTank does provide potential investors in an artist, an artist’s brand or a specific artistic project (i.e. music tours, music albums, etc.) with informational feedback on every artist and their artistic content on its platform via its information technology services, search engine filtering & ranking, data visualization dashboards, historical trending information, and its proprietary content score as a form of measurement that, in itself, is an indicator solely of the artists talent level compared to other artists on the FanTank platform.

 

BankRoll makes its own determination which artists and/or their respective artistic projects are added on its listing of equity crowdfunding opportunities on its site.  BankRoll has the right to refuse any recommendation made to BankRoll by FanTank in this regard.   It is up to the sole discretion of FanTank to recommend to BankRoll which artists and/or artistic projects are recommended to BankRoll for listing.  However, despite FanTank providing the above informational and ranking/measurement services and recommendations which artists and/or projects might be listed on BankRoll’s site; it does not endorse or recommend the purchase of, or investment in any securities, whether on the FanTank site, BankRoll site, or any other sites anywhere in the world.

 

All securities listed on the BankRoll website are being offered by the company issuing such securities, and all information included on this FanTank or BankRoll related to the sale of such securities is the responsibility of company issuing the securities, and the accuracy of such information is the sole responsibility of each such company. FanTank and BankRoll have not taken any steps to verify the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of any information. Neither FanTank or BankRoll nor any of its officers, directors, agents, attorneys and/or employees makes any warranty, excess or implied, of any kind whatsoever related to the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of any information on the BankRoll site or the use of any information on this site. By accessing this site and any pages thereof, you agree to be bound by FanTank’s and BankRoll's respective and different Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

 

No communication through this website or through BankRoll, or in any other medium, should be construed as a recommendation for any security offered on or off this technology platform. Any decision made to invest in any offering on the FanTank site and/or BankRoll’s investment platform is made solely by the investor based only on information contained in the offering documents prepared by the company issuing the security, or based upon the investor’s own due diligence and research. Potential investors should review all available information carefully, and consult their own advisors prior to making any investment decisions.

 

Investments in private placements, Regulation A+ offerings, Regulation CF offerings and start-up investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk and investors who cannot afford to lose their entire investment should not invest in such investments, start-ups or early stage companies. Companies seeking startup and early stage investments often are in early stages of development and the company's business model, products and services may not yet be fully developed, operational or tested in the public marketplace. There is no guarantee that the stated valuation and other terms are accurate or in agreement with the market or industry valuations. Additionally, investors may be investing in restricted stock or membership units that may be subject to holding period requirements, and may not be liquid for a significantly long period of time, or not liquid at all. In the most sensible investment strategy for start-up or early stage investing, start-ups and early stage companies should only be part of your overall investment portfolio, if at all. Investments in startups are often highly illiquid and investors who cannot hold an investment for several years, or possibly forever, should not invest.
